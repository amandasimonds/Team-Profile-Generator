Follow a CLI application to build a team profile with one manager, and any number or combination of interns and engineers.

The profile will be generated as a file named "team.html" in the main folder.

A new profile will overwrite the old one, every time you restart the app, so make sure you save the html file before starting a new one.

How to use this app:

1.Clone the repo
2.Open the code in the code editor of your choice
3.Install npm packages
4.Run <node app.js> in the terminal to start the CLI operation
